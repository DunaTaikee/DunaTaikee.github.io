# DunaTaikee.github.io

Welcome to DunaTaikee's website!
This is a static website done through CSS and HTML!
The website address is: dunataikee.github.io
The content of the site is divided into roughly four sections:
1) Some introductions about me and my 6 favorite anime.
2) Some articles from my friend's public website.
3) Some memorable moments in my life.
4) A user negotiation interface that allows me to input information to help me more easily get the personal information of the members who want to join our team (this backend is still under development, and will be updated continuously).
